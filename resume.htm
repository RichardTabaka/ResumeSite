                <p>
                    Since beginning the MSSA program I've taken the time to build a few little projects that I think are pretty cool! Here are some of my favorites.
                </p>
                <h3 class="tab"><a href="https://github.com/RichardTabaka/Sudoku_Solver">Sudoku Solver</a></h3>
                <p class="tab2">
                    Developed an application that allows a user to input a Sudoku puzzle then solves it and provides hints and a formatted solution.
                </p>

                <h3 class="tab"><a href="https://github.com/RichardTabaka/Value-Checker">Subscription Re-Evaluator</a></h3>
                <p class="tab2">
                    Developed a program that helps the user re-evaluate their subscriptions by comparing the monthly cost to the actual value received and returns all their values  in a table. I personally was able to use this program to cut my monthly subscription costs by over 30%.
                </p>

                <h3 class="tab">This Site!</h3>
                <p class="tab2">
                    This site is a very rough work in progress but it's something I've felt I would enjoy doing for a long time. The creativity it will allow me to show while also building a project I can be proud of and show prospective employers is awesome.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These projects all allowed me to hone my skills and work a little at building up my foundational knowledge of algorithms and converting my thoughts into text a computer can understand. I found them challenging and fun, creting new issues every turn of the way that made me head back to the drawing board to rethink my direction multiple times.
                </p>

                <h2>Experience:</h2>

                <h3 class="tab">Microsoft Software and Systems Academy</h3>
                <p class="tab2">
                    While in the MSSA program I managed to learn 6 programming languages in less than 4 months through St. Martin's University, maintaining a 4.0 GPA. The topics I learned ranged from database development to front end development but mainly focused on cloud application development. This program successfully transitioned me from a Combat Engineer within the Army to a Software Engineer.
                </p>

                <h3 class="tab">United States Army</h3>
                <p class="tab2">
                    I entered the Army as a Combat Engineer in March of 2018 and was given some amazing opportunities to do things I never could have imagined before I joined. My first year and a half was action packed and full of fun, spending weeks in the Desert then weeks in the woods getting rained on with some of the most amazing people I've had the pleasure of meeting.
                </p>
                <p class="tab2">
                    After that, I was moved to more of a desk job and given experience on the operations side of things. I was assigned as my company's Digital Training Management System operator where I Tracked and maintained records for a company of over 120 Soldiers. This is where I gained some of my most applicable experience to life outside the Army. I maintained my company's compliance of Army standards for multiple different mandatory trainings by verifying which soldiers had recieved training within the fiscal, calendar and rolling year depending on the task.
                </p>
                <p class="tab2">
                    I was also given the opportunity to identify and help fix key weaknesses within my company by compiling and manipulating data by section within my company. For example, I would calculate a 30/60/90 day out qualification roster, identifying 20+ Soldiers with qualifications that would expire soon and ensure that they attended the necessary training to prevent them falling out of standard.
                </p>
                <p class="tab2">
                    Finally, the most rewarding task I had was ensuring the timely promotion of my fellow Soldiers. Every month I gathered every certification and qualification the Soldiers eligible to be promoted would need, getting signatures and confirming the accuracy of these documents. I would then read through about 10 Soldiers' summaries in their board packets, ensuring they were well represented by them and that their biographies were error-free. This allowed typically about 5 soldiers per month to earn their Promotable status. </ br>
